After working in various mining industries for a total period of 3 years, he joined Indian Institute of Technology (BHU) for a Masters in engineering program. He acquired his M.Tech. in Mining Engineering in 1987 and was the topper of the class with a CGPA of 9.38 on 10. Prof. Rao started his teaching career as a Lecturer in Mining Engineering at&nbsp;then Karnataka Regional Engineering College (KREC), Surathkal, D. K., Karnataka during 1987-89. Later in the year 1989, he joined Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur in the Department of Mining Engineering as a Lecturer. He obtained his PhD in the field of Rock Mechanics from IIT Kharagpur. With a steady growth from Lecturer, he became a full Professor in 2004. As a Professor, Prof. Rao&nbsp;served IIT Kharagpur at various administrative positions. Some of important portfolios were as the Chairman Estate, and Vice Chairman Joint Entrance Exam (JEE). Prof. Rao was the Head of the Mining Engineering Department during 2006-08 and 2010-14.</p>
